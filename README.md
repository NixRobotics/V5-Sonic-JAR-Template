# V5-Sonic-JAR-Template

Debug Log:
- Haven't figured out how to reverse using odom drive routines. Need to use regular drive commands for now
- Odom accumulated error very quickly. Converted accumulation to run using doubles. Also increased sample rate to 10ms
- Some PID tuning for regular drive and turn
